#### Site Overview

In order to access the site, you must launch index.html, which will bring you to the login page. The login information should already be available for submitting, but there is an option to register as well. The login page
will then take you to the professor profile page, where you will be able to view your courses and add new ones. Clicking on a course link will lead you
to the main page for that course, where you can upload the student CSV (if the course is new), as well as add assignments to the Assignment tab.
You will also have the ability to log out via the Settings tab. Any functionality beyond this is only partially completed.

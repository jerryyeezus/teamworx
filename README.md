#### Site Overview

In order to access the site, you must launch index.html, which brings you to the login page. The login information should already be available
for submitting, but there is an option to register as well. The login page then takes you to the portal page, where you are able to view
and edit your profile, as well as view your courses (and add new ones if you are an instructor). Clicking on a course link leads you
to the main page for that course, where you can upload the student CSV (if the course is new and you are an instructor), as well as add/view
assignments in the Assignment tab. Additionally, currently you can select groups or students to view individual profiles, although these pages are
still partially under construction. If you are a student, you can also indicate whether or not you are looking for a group (LFG).
You also have the ability to log out via the Settings tab. Any functionality beyond this is only partially completed.
